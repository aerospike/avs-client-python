Welcome to Aerospike Vector Search Client for Python.

This package splits the client functionality into two separate clients.

This standard client (Client) specializes in performing database operations with vector data.
Moreover, the standard client supports Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) vector searches,
allowing users to find vectors similar to a given query vector within an index.

This admin client (AdminClient) is designed to conduct AVS administrative operation such
as creating indexes, querying index information, and dropping indexes.

Please explore the modules below for more information on API usage and details.

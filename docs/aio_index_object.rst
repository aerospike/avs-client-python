Index
======================

The Index class offers targeted functionality for managing and searching against an index in AVS.
You create an Index object by calling the :meth:`aerospike_vector_search.aio.Client.index` method. The index must already exist in AVS.
The Index object is the preferred way to interact with an index in AVS and offers improved performance
and ease of use.
